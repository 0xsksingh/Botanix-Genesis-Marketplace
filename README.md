## Fleek Storage SDK: Revolutionizing NFT Storage
To ensure true decentralization and align with the foundational principles of NFTs, the Genesis Marketplace leverages the Fleek Storage SDK for storing NFT assets on IPFS. This approach guarantees:

Censorship-resistant Storage: With IPFS, NFT assets are stored in a way that is resistant to censorship, ensuring your digital assets remain accessible and secure.
Immutable Asset Links: By storing assets on IPFS and utilizing CIDs (Content Identifiers), we ensure that each asset's link is permanent and unalterable, preserving the integrity of every NFT.
Seamless Integration: Our platform simplifies the process of uploading and referencing NFT assets on IPFS, making it effortless for creators to immortalize their work in the decentralized web.
