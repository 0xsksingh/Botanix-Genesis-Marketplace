Rentable BotanixNFTs

ERC4907 contract implements the ERC4907 interface. It extends the `ERC721Base` contract and adds functionality for managing users and expiration times for NFTs.

The contract defines a `UserInfo` struct that contains two fields: `user` and `expires`. The `user` field is an address that represents the user of the NFT, and the `expires` field is a `uint64` value that represents the Unix timestamp at which the user's access to the NFT expires.

The contract also defines a mapping called `_users` that maps NFT token IDs to `UserInfo` structs. This allows the contract to keep track of the user and expiration time for each NFT.

The `setUser` function allows the owner or an approved operator of an NFT to set the user and expiration time for the NFT. The function takes three arguments: `tokenId`, `user`, and `expires`. The `tokenId` argument specifies which NFT to update, the `user` argument specifies the new user of the NFT, and the `expires` argument specifies the new expiration time for the user's access to the NFT.

The contract also provides two view functions: `userOf` and `userExpires`. The `userOf` function returns the current user of an NFT, or the zero address if there is no user or if the user's access has expired. The `userExpires` function returns the expiration time for the user's access to an NFT.

Using this now the User can rent out the NFTs
